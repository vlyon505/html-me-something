        <h3>What is Biohacking?</h3>
        <p>Biohacking is a crazy-sounding name for something not
            crazy at all—the desire to be the absolute best version of ourselves.
            The main thing that separates a biohacker from the rest of the
            self-improvement world is a systems-thinking approach to our own
            biology.Biohackers use the tools of the Quantified Self to measure
            these inputs and outputs, and to experimentally test the effect
            of different tweaks</p>

            <h1>Step 1: Try Bulletproof Coffee</h1>
            <p id="coffee">Bulletproof Coffee is a branded coffee drink consisting of
                "upgraded" black coffee blended with grass-fed butter and
                "Brain Octane oil", an 8-carbon fraction of medium-chain
                triglyceride oil.[1] The recipe was created by Dave Asprey and
                 first posted to his blog in 2009.[2] Asprey claims that the
                  drink boosts cognitive performance and weight loss, and it
                  has been consumed by sportspeople[3] and Silicon Valley
                  entrepreneurs.

            <h1> Step 2: Get a Fitness Tracker</h1>
            <p id="tracker">On a simple level, fitness trackers provide an easy way to keep
                track of your daily steps as well as other points such as
                calories burned, water intake, sleep and more.Thoughts of
                recording these details, and looking at charts and graphs
                 does bring thoughts of the quantified self movement, but
                 there may be something a bit simpler than getting a fitness
                 tracker and jumping full swing in to that movement. Similar
                  to how someone would be told to keep a food diary if they
                  are trying to diet and lose weight — wearing a fitness tracker
                   and paying attention to the data will make you more aware of
                   your activity. Or more accurate in some cases, your inactivity.
                    If you are the type that goes from home to work and back
                    home spending your day at a desk — you may be surprised at
                    how few steps you are actually taking. It isn't hard to find
                    ways to take extra steps during the day, but on the flip side,
                     it is surprisingly easy to take very few steps.Those who
                     do pick up a fitness tracker should follow one bit of
                     advice to get started — you don't have to start wearing
                     the tracker and immediately going out for extra walks.
                     You should go about your normal routine the first few days
                     of wearing a tracker, this way you get a baseline of your
                     true activity. Once you have an idea of what you are doing
                     per day, then you can find ways to make changes and begin
                     getting the extra steps. Possibly even looking to get that
                     magical 10,000 steps per day down the line.Coming with
                     the motivation aspect, many of these fitness bands offer
                     badges. These badges are only virtual, but they should
                     still be fun to get, and fun to share with friends when
                     you feel like doing a little bit of bragging. Using Fitbit
                     as an example and you could get badges for reaching a record
                     number of steps per day or a record number of stair floors
                     climbed per day. Fitbit also has badges for lifetime achievements.

            <h1>Step 3: Begin the Self Care Journey</h1>
            <p id="care">&quot Extreme Self-Care involves surrounding myself with people who are smart,
                 self-aware and only interested in two way relationships. It means taking
                 bold steps, such as eliminating clutter from my life, for good;
                 creating a soul-nourishing work and home environment, and keeping
                 it that way, getting my financial act together so that I always
                 have choices about how to live my life and not making any commitments
                  whatsoever out of guilt and obligation.&quot
